# About Me

Hello! My name is Gaurav Sett. 

I work on AI policy. I am a PhD student at [RAND](https://rand.org){:target="_blank"} in its [policy graduate school](https://www.pardeerand.edu){:target="_blank"} in Washington, DC. 
My research focuses on governance for advanced AI systems. 
I have a BS and an MS in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](https://cc.gatech.edu){:target="_blank"}.

Outside work, I like to learn about our world, listen to music, walk in nature, and cook plants.
