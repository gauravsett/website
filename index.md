# About Me

Hello! My name is Gaurav Sett. 

Previously, I received a BS and MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. During my time in Atlanta, I co-founded the [AI Safety Initiative at Georgia Tech](https://aisi.dev){:target="_blank"}.

Currently, I am managing the AI Safety Initiative, working on a few AI alignment projects, and organizing an intercollegiate AI safety research program.

Soon, I aim to start a career in AI safety, policy, and strategy.

For more details, see my [resume](/assets/resume.pdf){:target="_blank"} or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauravsett/){:target="_blank"}.
