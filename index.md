# About Me

Hello! My name is Gaurav Sett. 

I am a PhD student in Policy Analysis at [RAND](https://rand.org) in its [graduate school](https://www.pardeerand.edu) in Washington, DC. I conduct research and advise policymakers on preparing to govern advanced AI systems. Before, I graduated with a BS and an MS in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](https://cc.gatech.edu). 

When I am not working,
I like to learn about our world, listen to music, walk in nature, and cook plants. 

To get in touch, contact me at <u>gauravsett[at]icloud[dot]com</u>, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauravsett/){:target="_blank"}, or follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/gauravsett){:target="_blank"}.
