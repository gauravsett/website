# About Me

Hello! My name is Gaurav Sett. 

I recently graduated with an MS in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. While in Atlanta, I founded the [AI Safety Initiative at Georgia Tech](https://aisi.dev){:target="_blank"}.

I am now pursuing a career in AI governance to address emergent risks from advanced systems. I am interested in opportunities to apply my technical experience in support of policy, coordination, and strategy efforts.

For more details, see my [resume](/assets/resume.pdf){:target="_blank"} or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauravsett/){:target="_blank"}.

Feel free to reach out at <u>gauravsett[at]icloud[dot]com</u>.
